Best practices associated with setting and declaring the properties of an Android user interface:

    Best practices in android application development address issues or responsivenss, accessability and internationalization (Deitel & Deitel. 2017).
    Responsiveness is a key imperative and design principal in mobile software development. Best practices in achieveing responsive views include,
    <ul>
        <li>
             using a responsive layout such as ConstraintLayout
        </li>
        <li>
             using different layouts for different devices.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Layouts are xml files in directory res/layout. They can be written or built with the LayoutEditor, so that each activity is paired to a particular layout. For example, MainActivity.java is paired to activity_main.xml by invoking setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
</p>
<p>Best practices call for accessible apps so that "users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your UI" (material.io. Accesibility)
    <blockquote>
        Improving your productâ€™s accessibility can enhance the usability for all users, including those with low vision, blindness, hearing impairments, cognitive impairments, motor impairments or situational disabilities (such as a broken arm).
        - material.io

Best practices for building an accessible UI include:
<ul>
    <li>
        Structuring components semantically and with good text descriptors that screen readers such as TalkBack can read. This is generally done by setting the contentDescription attribute of a view.

    </li>
    <li>Providing feedback through visual and textual cues, to guide user through an app.</li>
    <li>Provide a clear navigation interface.</li>
    <li>Clearly visible elements.</li>
        <li>Sufficient contrast and size.</li>
        <li>A clear hierarchy of importance.</li>
        <li>Highlight key information.</li>
    
</ul>
</p>
<p>Much as we can specify different layouts for different devices we can also specify different layouts for different <em>countries</em>. Android can then automatically load the resources that match the devices locale settings (Deitel & Deitel. p. 70). Other steps in internationalizing an app include providing translastions of needed strings in a resource file,</p>
