It is up to the developer however to include meaningul messages and to organize visual components in a semantic way, and group view items for easy clickability.</p>
<p>AccessibilityScanner will analyze your code an identify issues around accessibility. It is downloaded from Google Play, onto a development device, or configured in an emulator, and once you have it setup you can use it  while navigating through an app on your device. It will make suggestions and store these in a folder where you can look them up  </p>
