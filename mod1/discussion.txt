Discuss how you would utilize activities, intents, fragments, services, and content providers in an Android application that you are tasked with developing

emulator or actual devic
layout editor, which is built from ViewGroup objects (containers) and View objects (buttons and stuff)

a project is a container
	files
	assets
	settings
	layout - buttons, text boxes, scrollables, menus
	SDK
	
	
app components
	- activitites
		a single screen with stuff on it. a view ...a 		page?... they are independent of 		     	eachother ...modules... classes?
		activities help to ...
			- track the current activity
			- remember past activites
			- go back to previous states
			- user flows and coordinating stuff
			
		activities work togehter but they are loosely bound. manage activity lifecycles.

	- services
		- a service runs in the background with no UI
		- might fetch data asynchronously, or play music
	- broadcast receivers
		- system wide message like low battery charge
	- content prviders are basically the databases these things query
	
	- intents
		- messaging objects methods? functions? startActivity(), or start a service with a job scheduler or deliver a broadcast
		- takes a component name (sounds like a method name)
		- takes an action
